        <h2>WHY DOES GIGALOST EXIST?</h2>
        <p>GIGALOST WAS CREATED WITH A CLEAR MISSION</p>
        <p>to bring back the true essence of memecoins.
           Over the years, the crypto space has changed drastically,many memecoins have become nothing more than
           quick hype cycles pump-and-dump schemes, and empty promises.
           The original spirit, the fun, and the community that once made memecoins great, have slowly faded away.
           GigaLost is a response to this trend. There are no political agendas, no quick cash grabs, and no fake hype
           just a community that wants to laugh, dream, and build something meaningful together</p>

        <img src="logo5.png">
        <h1>THE MEANING BEHIND THE NAME</h1>
        
        <h2>GIGA – Loyalty, Brotherhood, and Big Dreams</h2>
        <p>“GIGA” is more than just an exaggeration—it represents <b>unbreakable loyalty</b> within the community
            the bond between brothers and sisters, and the <b>desire to think big and aim high</b>.
            Being part of GigaLost means understanding that it’s not just about the token itself
            it’s about what we can create together: <b>a movement that goes beyond just memes</b>
        
        <h2>LOST – Fun, Chaos, and the Freedom to Not Take Everything Seriously</h2>
        <p>“LOST” embodies what memecoins have always been about: <b>fun, humor, and a carefree atmosphere</b>.
            In a world that often takes itself too seriously, there needs to be a space where everyone is equal
            where you don’t have to pretend, and where unfiltered joy is the priority.
            GigaLost is that place, <b>a space where everyone is welcome to have a laugh and enjoy the ride</b>
            <img src="logo6.png">
            <h1>The Vision & Plans for the Future</h1>
            
            <p>GigaLost is not just another memecoin on Solana.
               It is a community-driven movement that aims to bring memecoins back
               to where they belong: <b>at the heart of internet culture, viral trends, and an ecosystem fueled by real engagement</b>
        
                <h2>Our plans include</h2>
                <b>✅ Old-School Memecoin Spirit</b> – No unnecessary complexities, no manipulative tokenomics, and no shady mechanics.
                Just a token that thrives on its <b>community and viral energy</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>✅ Strategic Partnerships & Listings</b> – Our goal is to establish GigaLost on <b>top-tier
                decentralized and centralized exchanges</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>✅ Long-Term Sustainability</b> – While many memecoins fade away within weeks,
                GigaLost is built for <b>organic and long-term growth</b>,
                with <b>community events, collaborations, and creative projects</b> to keep it thriving.

                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <h2>GigaLost is for Those Who Truly Love Memecoins</h2>
                
                <p>GigaLost is a <b>statement against the modern crypto circus</b>, where memecoins are often reduced to pure speculation.
                We are bringing back the golden days—when memecoins were <b>fun, when memes were the most valuable currency,
                and when community mattered more than profit</b>.
